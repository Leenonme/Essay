ADA Academy Essay Questions
 
 
 
###1. Why are you interested in Programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?  

  I have held a fascination with programing, steaming mainly from the internet, and my love for Photography. 
It began in high school and continues to this day of me spending hours looking at artist work and sharing my own. 
I knew I wanted to graduate college with a website I designed. While studying at Columbus College of Art and Design 
I sought after more advanced digital training than what was offered to Photo Majors at the time. I took the Photoshop 
and Wed Design classes from the graphic deign curriculum. After years of working freelance as a photographer, I was ready 
for a more consistent job path. In 2013  I again was seeking for more digital knowledge and reapplied to my Ala mater to 
take a few courses to help me transition into the web design field. I was accepted. However life intervened  and I had to 
set that aside, to focus on my fathers losing battle to cancer. In the summer of 2015 my best friend took a coding bootcamp 
in Chicago. I’ve seen it positively change her career in many ways. She inspired me to look into coding again, and I 
downloaded Code Academy. It was something that I played around with, but I didn’t believe it was something I could turn 
into a career alone.



###2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

Following the same mantra I carry with me now, and that is me dedicating my resources working towards the greater good, bettering the life of people in some small way, and trying to leave this planet better then when I got here. I discovered something in myself a few years ago that if I want to feel successful, I need to know I’m making a positive impact on something, even if its just to one person, creature, or small area on the planet. I like to think that after 5 years of establishing myself within the tech industry I have become a valuable resource mentoring others.


###3. After Reading Ada’s Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, How will you contribute to Ada’s Vision for the an inclusive and diverse community?

First I would like to state that I cried after reading Ada’s mission statement, and then immediately read every single word 
on the website. With my current career and circumstances, my only contribution is my continued open mind of acceptance, 
compassion, and solidarity for the women and other minorities the of the world working on breaking the glass ceiling.

I believe you should always give back to what you receive, after I  graduate from ADA academy, I would do my part in in 
many ways. First it would to be to my employer and to the tech community showing that I belong in the field, and that an 
Ada graduate is a asset to their company. Secondly I would 100% donate, I’ve been making ends meet on a yearly income under 
$23,000, after gradating that would be a potential triple compensation increase for me. I could start saving, stop living 
paycheck paycheck, no longer borrowing money for emergencies, and start giving back to the people and organizations that 
helped raise me up. Lastly but not least I would mentor/volunteer to ada, in all the ways available to me. One thing that 
really inspired me to apply were the previous graduates testimonials. Reading about there previous career’s before and 
after ada inspired me, and made me believe that is something that I could so also. 

###4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

One of the bigger mistakes I’ve made took me about 7 years to realize. In my freshman year of college, I should have pushed myself to study something new and to stop studying something I already knew. In high school, photography was what I was good at, my art won a Scholastic National award. My pictures hung in New York and Washington D.C.. I received praise from my academic teacher’s,  were as being a C-B student,  it was something I didn’t receive in the past. College was not something I envisioned for myself immediately after high school. Now college’s were handing me large scholarships, the largest being from my Columbus College Art of Design, awarding 2 years paid for students receiving national recognition. So i stuck with photography, but by my junior year of college I was bored, dispassionate, and depressed. My teachers and mentors saw it. I dragged my feet the rest of the way knowing there was a light at the end of the tunnel and when I graduated I could move to a big city to find myself. The summer I graduted I moved to Chicago. I quickly befriended many of Chicago’s Commercial Photographer’s, and have great memories working with them on photoshoot’s, but my own career never took off, and female assiants were not many photogphaers fisrt call. Then the demand of repaying the my student loans, begain. I took a steady job, then another one and another one, until i realized at 27 I’m not a photographer at all, I’m unhappyly employed at a dead end retail job.
	I feel like I am at that a simlaier situation, again, I could stay in Columbus, where I can continue to do what I already know. Or I could drop everything move across the country and learn something new. I going to end this with a quote from wise women, who’s words have resonated with me.
