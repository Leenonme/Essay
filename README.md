ADA Academy Essay Questions
 
 
 
###1. Why are you interested in Programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?  

Not one day passes without my life being affected by the choices of a programmer or a developer in some way. Technology is ingrained in our daily lives and can easily go unnoticed by some. On a typical day my exposer happens when I first wakeup and stop my iPhone alarm. Then I use technology hundreds of different ways throughout the day. Signing up for a yoga class on Mind body, comparing prices on Amazon, playing Two-Dots while waiting in line, or sending money through Venmo. It doesn't stop when I’m traveling either. A programmer is helping me download my electronic boarding pass and they give me a wide variety of filter’s for my Instagram photos.

In the mid 2000’s while studying photography at Columbus College of Art and Design (CCAD) I sought after more advanced digital training than what was offered in the photo department at the time. I took Photoshop and web design classes created for the graphic design curriculum and built my own website using Dream Weaver. After years of working freelance as a photographer and random part-time jobs for supplemental income, I was ready for a more stable career. In 2014, I wanted to better myself and expand my digital knowledge. I reapplied to CCAD and was accepted with the aspirations of taking courses to help me transition into the web design field. However, life intervened and I had to set that aside to focus on my father’s battle to cancer. The following summer my best friend took a coding boot camp in Chicago that catered to graphic designers. I’ve seen it positively change her career in many ways and her success inspired me to look into coding. I used Code Academy and played around with it, but I didn’t believe it was something I could confidently learn on my own without an educational platform. I researched other coding programs however they currently remain financially inaccessible. I was very excited when first learning about ADA Academy, not only is this an amazing opportunity, but also a life altering experience without incurring the financial burden.  I feel the 6 months of school followed by the Internship is going to give me the confidence and empowerment to reenter the work force as a Full Stack Developer.


###2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

Following the same mantras I carry with me now, which is dedicating my work and life towards the greater good, improving the life of people in some small way, and trying to leave this planet a better place than when I got here. I want to stay true to myself and give back. I discovered that if I want to feel successful, I need to know I’m making a positive impact on something. 5 years from now I’ll be working at an organization that supports those same values and encourages their employees to give back.


###3. After Reading Ada’s Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, How will you contribute to Ada’s Vision for the an inclusive and diverse community?

ADA’s Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement provoked an overwhelming emotional response that has continued to resonate within me. I suddenly felt awake with boundless possibility.

My contribution to ADA would be my continued open mind, acceptance, compassion, and solidarity for the women and other minorities in the world breaking the glass ceiling. I believe everyone should always give back more than what they receive. When I become an ADA graduate, I will do my part in many ways. I would work passionately with my employer and to the tech community, proving to them that I belong in the field and that ADA graduates are a strong asset to their company. I will contribute back to ADA who enabled me to be successful.   I would start saving and start giving back to the people and organizations that helped rise me up. Last but not least I would mentor and volunteer to ADA and my community. A key thing that truly inspired me to apply was the ADA graduates testimonials. Reading about their previous career’s before and after ADA, made me believe in myself, and that I too have to capability to change by life. I would hope that in the future my own experience could inspire others as well.



###4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

One of the bigger mistakes I’ve made took me about 7 years to realize. In my freshman year of college, I should have left my comfort zone by studying something new and stopped studying something I already knew. During high school, photography was what I was good at, my art won a Scholastic National award, and my pictures were displayed in Washington D.C. and New York City. Suddenly, I was receiving praise from my academic teachers. As an average preforming student, this was something completely new to me. Before the recognition, I didn’t have aspirations for college directly out of high school. Now colleges were handing me large scholarships, the most generous one being from Columbus College Art of Design. During freshman year I stayed with what I was familiar with by continuing with photography. By the time I was a junior in college I was bored, dispassionate, and depressed. My teachers and mentors saw it. I got through college knowing what after graduation, I would move to a big city to hopefully find myself.

I landed in Chicago with my feet running. I quickly befriended many of Chicago’s commercial photographers and began working with them closely. I have great memories working with them on photo shoots. However, after a year of working freelance my own career didn’t take off, and female assistants were not many photographers first choice for a shoot. Then the demand of repaying my student loans, begin. So, I took a steady job, then another, followed by another. Until, suddenly I was 27 years old, 5 years out of college, no longer a photographer, and unhappily employed at a dead end retail job. I also came to terms that photography is something that I love, but not way to support myself. The past few years, I’ve been working with emotionally disabled children with Columbus City Schools. It’s been extremely gratifying building strong positive relationships with the students. I’ve witnessed the effects of poverty, drug addiction, and mental illness on children. All of my students have faced hardships that I’ll never be able to comprehend. It has completely humbled me and changed my perspective on societal issues. I know without a doubt their lives have impacted me more than I have impacted theirs. I would like to say that this job is something I can continue to do, but I know in myself this is not something I can sustain. My role at the school is extremely emotionally and physically overwhelming. In order for me to have a larger impact on this demographic I need to have more resources and tools. ADA is the source I am looking for.

I feel like I am at that same crossroads, again. I could stay in Columbus, where I can continue to do what I already know. Or I could seize this enormous opportunity, move across the country, leave my comfort zone, and push myself into the unknown and learn something new. I know this is the right choice for me, I hope you do too.
