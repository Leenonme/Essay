ADA Academy Essay Questions
 
 
 
###1. Why are you interested in Programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?  

Not one day passes without my life being affected by the choices of a programmer, or developer in some way. Technology is ingrained in our daily lives, and can easily go unnoticed by some.  On a typical day my exposer happens when I first wakeup and stop my IPhone alarm. Then I use it hundreds of different ways through out the day. Signing up for a yoga class on Mindbody,  seeing if a price is cheaper on Amazon, playing Two-Dots while waiting in line, or sending money threw Venmo. It doesn't stop when I’m on vacation to a remote island either. A programer is helping me download my electronic boarding pass, and they give me a wide variety of filter’s for my Instagram pictures.
In the mid 2000’s while studying photography at Columbus College of Art and Design I sought after more advanced digital training than what was offered in the photo department at the time. I took the Photoshop and web design classes created for the graphic design curriculum. By the time I graduated I had built my own website, using Dream Weaver. After years of working freelance as a photographer, and random part-time jobs for supplemental income, I was ready for a more stable career. In 2014 I wanted to better myself and expand my digital knowledge. I reapplied to my alma mater and was accepted, with the hopes of taking courses to help me transition into the web design field. However life intervened and I had to set that aside, to focus on my fathers losing battle to cancer. The following summer my best friend took a coding bootcamp in Chicago, that catered to graphic designers. I’ve seen it positively change her career in many ways. I knew that bootcamp was not right for me but, her success inspired me to look into coding. I downloaded Code Academy, and played around with it, but I didn’t believe it was something I could confidently learn on my own. I researched other coding bootcamps, however they remain financially unaccessible. I became very excited when first hearing about ADA Academy, not only is it a program I can realistically  pursue, without adding debt. It also is more comprehensive training then other courses I researched. I believe the 6 months of school followed by the Internship is going to give me the confidence needed to reenter the work force as a Full Stack Developer. 


###2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

Following the same mantras I carry with me now, and that is dedicating my work and life towards the greater good, bettering the life of people in some small way, and trying to leave this planet better then when I got here. I discovered something in myself a few years ago and that is if I want to feel successful, I need to know I’m making a positive impact on something. Whether if its just to one person, creature, or small area on the planet.  5 years from now I’ll be working at a company that supports those same values, and encourages its employs to give back. 


###3. After Reading Ada’s Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, How will you contribute to Ada’s Vision for the an inclusive and diverse community?

First I would like to say ADA’s vision and mission, provoked a overwhelming emotional response deep within me. I suddenly felt awake, with boundless possibility. In my current career and circumstances, my contribution to ADA is my continued open mind, acceptance, compassion, and solidarity for the women and other minorities in the world working on breaking the glass ceiling.
I believe we should always give back more then what we receive. When I become an ADA graduate, I would do my part in in many ways. First it would to be to my employer and to the tech community showing them that I belong in the field, and that ADA graduates are a strong asset to their company. Secondly I would 100% financially donate. I’ve been getting by on a yearly income under $23,000, after gradating I would potentially triple my compensation. I could start saving, stop living paycheck to paycheck, no longer borrowing money for emergencies, and start giving back to the people and organizations that helped rise me up. Last but not least I would mentor/volunteer to ADA, in all the ways available to me. One thing that truly inspired me to apply were the ADA graduates testimonials. Reading about their previous career’s before and after ADA, made me believe in myself, and that I too have to capability to change by life. I would hope that in the future my own experience could inspire others.

###4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

One of the bigger mistakes I’ve made took me about 7 years to realize. In my freshman year of college, I should have left my comfort zone and studied something new and stopped studying something I already knew. 
During high school, photography was what I was good at, my art won a Scholastic National award. My pictures hung in D.C. and New York. Suddenly I was receiving praise from my academic teacher’s, as an average preforming student it was something completely new to me. Before the recognition I didn’t have aspirations for College directly out of high school. Now college’s were handing me large scholarships, the most generous being from Columbus College Art of Design, awarding me a half ride tuition. During Freshman year I stayed with what I was familiar with and continued with Photography. By my junior year of college I was bored, dispassionate, and depressed. My teachers and mentors saw it. I dragged my feet the rest of the way, and I didn't reach the potential I knew that was in me. 

When I graduated I was excited to move to a big city to find myself, I landed in Chicago with my feet running. I quickly befriended many of Chicago’s Commercial Photographer’s, and have great memories working with them on photoshoots.  However after a year of working freelance my own career didn’t take off, and female assistants were not many photographers first call. Then the demand of repaying my student loans, begin. I took a steady job, then another, followed by another one. Until suddenly I was 27 years old, 5 years out of college, no longer a photographer, and unhappily employed at a dead end retail job. I also came to terms that photography is something that I love, but not a way to support myself. 
The past few years, I’ve been working with emotionally disabled children with Columbus Public Schools. It’s been extremely gratifying building strong positive relationships with the students. I’ve witnessed the effects of poverty, drug addiction, and mental illness on children. All of my students have faced hardships, I’ll never be able to comprehend. It has completely humbled me and changed my perspective on societal issues. I know without a doubt their lives have impacted me more, then I have had on theirs. I would like to say that this job is something I can continue to do, but I know in myself this is not something I can sustain. My role at the school is extremely emotionally and  physically overwhelming, and the wage isn’t enough for me to be independent.

I feel like I am at that same crossroads, again. I could stay in Columbus, where I can continue to do what I already know. Or I could seize this enormous opportunity, move across the country, leave my comfort zone, and push myself into the unknown and learn something new. I think it time for me to scare my melfy a little bit. I know this is the right choice for me, I hope you do too.
